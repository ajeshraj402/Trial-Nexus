Assessments of pain are made pre-operatively, upon arrival to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), every second hour the first day, twice a day during the remaining hospital stay and at follow-up visits 3 and 12 months after surgery. Plasma levels of troponin T (TNT) are measured three times during the first 24 postoperative hours in order to evaluate signs of myocardial ischemic events. The Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire (SPMSQ) is used to evaluate the cognitive function pre-operatively, at the discharge and at follow-up visits 3 and 12 months after surgery. Global satisfaction score is assessed with a VAS (0 = best possible satisfaction, 100 = least possible satisfaction) at follow-up visits 3 and 12 months after surgery.",
