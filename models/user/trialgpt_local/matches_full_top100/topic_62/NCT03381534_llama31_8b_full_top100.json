Neck auscultation revealed a systolic murmur in the neck, radiating to the skull. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries revealed severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (LICA) and moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery (RICA). Plaque was observed in the anterior and posterior walls of the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery.",
